# Instructor Development Committee Roles and Membership

## Roles

There are multiple ways to be involved with the Instructor Development Committee and its activities.  

### Participation in Instructor Development Activities

Any SWC/DC community member can participate in Instructor Development Committee activities in 
the following ways: 

* [Discussion Session Participant](roles/discussion-participants.md)
	- Join a discussion about teaching workshops.  
* [Discussion Session Host/Co-Host](roles/discussion-hosts.md)
	- Lead a discussion among fellow instructors about recent or upcoming workshops. 
* [Mentor](roles/mentors.md)
	- Work with a small group of new instructors to provide support and guidance.
* [Mentee](roles/mentees.md)
	- Work with a mentor and fellow new instructors to prepare for teaching the 
	Software and Data Carpentry lessons, organizing workshops, and participation in the 
	Software and Data Carpentry communities.  

Participating in these events does not require that you join the Committee as a member.  

### Mentoring Committee Membership

For those interested in becoming involved with the Committee and helping organize 
and run the above (and new!) efforts, we welcome new Instructor Development Committee members.  

Instructor Development Committee membership is open to anyone who is: 

* a certified instructor
* in the process of becoming certified (have attended instructor training 
or be confirmed to attend an upcoming training)
* active in the SWC/DC community as a helper, instructor, or contributor

Membership consists of: 
* joining the [Instructor Development Committee mailing list][comm-mailing-list]
* attending at least one meeting of the Committee every 2-4 months
* contributing to the Committee's efforts in some way, including
	* taking on an official committee role (see below)
	* participating in Instructor Development Committee activities (see above)
	* spearheading a task force or starting a new committee
	* ...or something else!  

All members of the Instructor Development Committee are expected to abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).   

See the [README](README.md) for a list of current members.  

### Instructor Development Committee Positions

These roles are filled by [members](#mentoring-committee-membership) of the 
Committee, in order to support its operation and activities.  

* [Chair and Vice-Chair](roles/chair-and-vice.md)
	- Coordinate mentoring efforts, organize and lead Instructor Development Committee meetings
* [Secretary](roles/secretary.md)
	- Take notes in Instructor Development Committee meetings, submit official minutes

## Choosing Instructor Development Committee Member Roles

Instructor Development Committee positions are to be filled yearly, in March.  Members 
can volunteer for any role.  Roles are filled in the order listed 
above, by a majority vote.  Whenever possible roles should
be filled by unique people; however, if there are not enough volunteers, 
one person may hold up to two positions.  

In the case that a member is not able to fulfill the duties of their role for the 
full term, a member will be chosen to fill that role until the time of the next 
turnover.

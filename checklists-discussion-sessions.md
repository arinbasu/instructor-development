# Checklists - Instructor Discussion Sessions

> This document contains checklists for the people involved 
> in instructor discussion sessions.  The full procedure is described 
> on [this page](procedure-discussion-session.md).  

Discussion sessions are organized and conducted through this etherpad: 

[http://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions](http://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions)

## Leading the Discussion
- [ ] Sign on as close to the start time as you can.  
- [ ] Confirm that your fellow host is present (if there is one) and who will be leading/taking notes
- [ ] (Optional) If a group is very large and you have a co-host, you can split the group in two, using the Breakout Rooms feature in Zoom.  
- [ ] Copy the agenda from the bottom of the etherpad to the space under your time slot
- [ ] Lead the discussion
	- We recommend following the main points of the agenda, but feel free to let discussion go where people want.  Not all the questions need to be answered by everyone.  
	- Don't feel like *you* have to answer all the questions as the host - draw on the 
	other discussion participants to answer each other's questions.  
	- If someone is attending as part of their training checkout, prompt them to ask a question. 
	- Try to leave enough time at the end for the final agenda item.  
- [ ] Take notes

## After the discussion
- [ ] Archive the etherpad by clicking on the star in the top right corner.  
- [ ] **Fill out the [host questionnaire](https://goo.gl/forms/iXkMQABmO6HROfCy1)**
	- *Note:* Please copy the list of attendees (including all attendees but removing no-shows) and paste it into question 7 of the questionnaire. 
	- This questionnaire will automatically send an email to the mentoring co-chairs and to checkout@carpentries.org.
- [ ] Clear the information from your session (date/time, attendees, notes) from the etherpad. 
- [ ] (Optional) write a blog post about interesting points that came up in discussion; see 
[this template](template-blog-about-debriefing-session.md) as a starting point.

# The Instructor Development Committee

## Purpose and Scope

The Committee was established in 2015 (originally the Mentoring Subcommittee) to develop and maintain a mentorship program to support instructors as they progress through training, teaching, curriculum development, and other community-related activities. We help promote community-building and networking by providing (virtual) spaces where instructors from all over the world can share teaching success stories and discuss strategies for overcoming challenges. In August 2018, the group was renamed to the Instructor Development Committee to reflect the wider focus of its activity and to avoid confusion with the Mentoring Groups Program.

## What We Do

### Instructor Discussion Sessions

Each week, volunteers host two instructor discussion sessions. The sessions provide a forum where experienced and novice instructors can discuss past and/or upcoming workshops. Instructors who have just taught, are about to teach, or have just completed instructor training will  receive an email invitation to these meetings, but these sessions are open to anyone.

To find an upcoming session, visit [this etherpad][discussion].

### Mentoring Groups

Mentoring groups support instructors by matching them with a personal mentor. Mentors will guide small groups (~4-5) of mentees, guiding them through specific goals including preparing to teach a workshop, maintaining lessons, building local communities, and organizing workshops.

See [this page](https://github.com/carpentries/mentoring/blob/master/mentoring-groups/program-outline.md) for a full outline of the program.

## Mentoring Committee Meetings

The Instructor Development Committee itself meets on the third Monday of every month to 
evaluate current activities, and propose
new activities.  Minutes of past meetings are available [here](minutes).  All community
members are welcome to attend these meetings.  Similarly, we welcome
anyone who is interested in joining up and helping out!

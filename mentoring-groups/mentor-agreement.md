## Carpentries Mentor Agreement
 
I agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](http://www.datacarpentry.org/code-of-conduct/) in all communications and interactions 
with The Carpentries community and to [promptly report any violations of the CoC](https://software-carpentry.org/CoC-reporting/) that I become aware of.
 
When interacting with my mentoring group, I agree to 
+ communicate The Carpentries community values to mentees and model that behaviour myself in how I mentor,   
+ provide a welcoming and supporting environment for mentees,
+ avoid dismissive language, question my expert blind spot, and model error-making as a vital part of the mentoring process.
 
I understand that it is important to keep in touch with The Carpentries community so that my mentorship will reflect current practices. I agree to:  
+ stay active in one or more Carpentries communication channels,   
+ keep up-to-date with changes to the lesson(s) I teach, and 
+ provide feedback to the Mentoring Subcommittee and Carpentries staff to help continue improving our mentoring groups.

# Mentoring Groups Virtual Showcase

## The Carpentries Mentoring Groups
The Carpentries mentoring groups have been working on teaching, lesson maintenance, workshop organization, and community building projects since October 2017. There were 59 people involved in this second round of mentoring groups (20 mentors and 39 mentees).

## Virtual Showcase
The Carpentries' community is invited to participate in a Virtual Showcase of our mentoring groups' projects.
  - __What to expect:__ Each group will present one slide outlining something cool they learned or completed with their mentoring group. We will also answer questions from the community and discuss the benefits of mentoring.
  - __Why attend:__ Be inspired by the projects of __your__ global community members! Be empowered to start a new project, contribute to a lesson, or prepare to teach a lesson. Explore the benefits of mentoring and being a part of a global community.

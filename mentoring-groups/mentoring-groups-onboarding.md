# Mentoring Groups Onboarding
The inaugural mentoring groups were developed and piloted in January 2017 by [Erin Becker](https://github.com/ErinBecker). The strategy below was outlined by [Kari L. Jordan](https://github.com/kariljordan) in October 2017, and the second round of mentoring groups ran October 2017 through January 2018.

See [this blog post](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/mentorship-wrap-up/) for more information about how we transitioned the mentoring groups from its pilot phase.

## Recruitment Strategy

+ **Recruitment**
  + Mentoring groups are open to any individual having gone through the [Carpentries instructor training](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/).
  + Individuals having taught zero to two workshops are welcomed to be mentees.
  + Individuals having taught three or more workshops are welcomed to lead mentoring groups as mentors.
+ **Activities & Timing**
  + Mentoring groups are run between 8 and 12 weeks.
  + Kari Jordan will hold a mentoring groups touch base with mentors half way through the 8-12 week period.
  + A [survey](https://goo.gl/forms/BOxgiKy99kVec07j2) will be administered to mentors and mentees half way through the 8-12 week period.
  + The 8-12 week period will end with a virtual showcase.
  + A [survey](https://goo.gl/forms/I36OUFXGAofLps8E3) will be administered to mentors and mentees at the end of the mentoring group period.
+ **Exposure**
  + A mentoring page will be added to Data/Software Carpentry's website with information for how to join a mentoring group.
  + Members will be added to groups, and new groups will be formed, on a rolling basis as needed, per the discretion of Kari Jordan.
  + The Mentoring Subcommittee will be instrumental in getting the word out about mentoring groups.

### Recruiting Mentors

Dear [INSERT FIRST NAME]

Carpentries mentoring groups have been extremely successful, and we have used the feedback we received from both mentors and mentees to craft a new and improved mentoring experience for both mentors and mentees in round two.

We’d like to invite you to lead a mentoring group! With your leadership, participants have the opportunity to learn from each other and reach specific goals around teaching, lesson maintenance, workshop operations, and/or community building.

Our mentors are experienced instructors who are committed to helping others become engaged members of the Carpentries community. Mentors have told us they really enjoy being involved with this program. 
                   
If you are interested in learning more, please sign up for the information session on [XXX] via this Etherpad [1]. If you would like to be involved, but can’t attend the information session, please let us know. The deadline to sign up to be a mentor is [XXX]. To sign up, simply complete the Google form for mentors [2].
                                     
We are looking forward to seeing you at an information session!
                   
Sincerely,  
Kari L. Jordan

### Recruiting Mentees

Dear [INSERT NAME],

Welcome, and thank you for joining the Carpentries community! We are delighted that you share our vision of bringing computational and data literacy to the global research community.

We invite you to join a mentoring group. We match new instructors with experienced community members who can answer questions about the Carpentries related to teaching, lesson maintenance, organizing workshops, and community building. If possible, we will try to match you with people close by to help strengthen your local Carpentries community.

Your mentor will hold regular meetings with your mentoring group (these are usually small - around 4-5 people) to help prepare you to teach or to maintain lessons, depending on which group you sign up for. Mentors might hold practice teaching sessions or Q&A sessions on lesson content. They may walk you through workshop logistics, or help you create workshop websites. Each group will work differently as the mentor will try to meet the needs of individual groups.

We strongly encourage you to take advantage of our mentoring groups. If you are interested in joining, please sign up via this Google form [1].

Mentors are dedicated, experienced instructors who are committed to helping you become engaged members of the Carpentries community. We are confident that you will benefit from their experience. Spaces in the program are limited, so please sign up as soon as you can. The deadline for applications is [XXX].

Still not sure? We will be offering an information session on [XXX]. You can bring any questions you have to that session. All the details of time zone conversion and how to connect are on this Etherpad [2]. 

We look forward to having you in the program!

Regards,  
Kari L. Jordan

### Updates
+ On July 18, 2018, Kari L. Jordan revised the mentor and mentee applications such that they select their timezone **and** timeslots when they are available to meet. This approach will be used for the next round of mentoring so that it's easier to schedule meeting times.

+ On March 8, 2018, Kari L. Jordan updated the mentoring groups sign-up process. Kari created [this Etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/mentoring-groups) to assign mentees to mentoring groups. For a synopsis of the previous mentoring group round, see [this blog post](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/Mentoring-Groups-Virtual-Showcase/).

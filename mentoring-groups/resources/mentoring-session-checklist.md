### Mentoring Session Checklist

At minimum, in each session we recommend that you identify goals to be achieved, and set a date/time for the next meeting. Here are a few more items that you may choose to include in each mentoring session.

+ Introductions and [Icebreakers](https://www.thebalance.com/fun-ice-breaker-questions-1918413) 
+ Review the Carpentries communication channels.
+ Review and discuss mentoring group objectives.
+ Discuss current challenges around your mentoring topic questions. 
+ Set [SMART Goals](http://www.hr.virginia.edu/uploads/documents/media/Writing_SMART_Goals.pdf) to surmount the groups challenges.

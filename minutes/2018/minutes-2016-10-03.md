## Agenda

Introductions
 
Recap since past meeting
* Update on roadmap (passed or not): http://pad.software-carpentry.org/mentoring-subcom-roadmap 
 
Main agenda items
* Mentoring meeting time + format
* Instructor discussion sessions: http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion
	* Host/Instructor sign-ups?
		* Helpful to get occasional reminder to sign up to host --> not annoying to get an email every week to sign-up
		* Consistent morning (EST) time + alternate later/earlier time
		* If there aren't at least two people signed up to attend --> have an announcement
		* More of a gap, between community members + more involved people --> need more community management
		* More casual, 
		* solicit through next month's newsletter+1
	* Standing agenda item: suggestions for questions to add to the discussion session agenda
		* Is it time to swap out these questions?
		* Specific instructor requests for resource library videos (to replace questions on communications after two weeks?) What would be useful beyond lesson materials?
		* Example discussion: https://github.com/swcarpentry/instructor-training/issues/198
		* How are people using the instructor notes/guides?
* Carpentries page / mentoring repository update
	* Staff project: Tracy/Jonah/Erin
* Wishlist: What do you wish we could be doing?  Starting point: https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/pull/71
	* Upcoming maintainers project: improve instructor notes
	* "How do I pick the materials to teach?"
	* Lesson-specific sessions: talk to Bridge committee --> use a community call

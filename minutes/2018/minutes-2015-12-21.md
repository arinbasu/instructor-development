## Post Workshop Debriefing Sessions - Procedure

Pull request at https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/pull/50.

Changes requested:

1.  Let attendees create the issue and pull requests.

    Concern: need someone to wrangle pull requests. The maintainer would be responsible.

    Issues would be more tractable, especially for big overarching issues.
2.  Add a section about when blogs should happen and the logistics of the blog posts.
3.  Template for blog post: include facilitator and participant names.

## Pre Workshop Help Sessions

No updates.

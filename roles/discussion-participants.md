# Discussion Participants

## Discussions are for everyone!

Anyone who is interested in meeting other Carpentry instructors 
and sharing ideas is welcome to join a discussion session.  In particular: 

- experienced instructors (have taught or organized 1-2 workshops 
or more), who can help the discussion hosts answer questions and share 
their own experience. 
- instructors-in-training who are going through the [training checkout][checkout] 
process. 
- instructors about to teach a workshop who have questions or are 
looking for teaching suggestions.
-  instructors who have just taught a workshop, to share how it went and 
what others can learn from their experiences.  

## To Join a Discussion

Sign up on the [discussion etherpad][discussion-etherpad].  There are 
specific slots for those who are debriefing from a workshop, looking for 
pre-workshop advice, or participating in the instructor training checkout process. 
If you don't fall into any of those categories, add your name at the end of 
the sign-up list for a particular call.

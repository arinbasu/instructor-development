When creating a new event or updating a old one.

![Calendar event steps](/img/calendar-event.png)

1. Set the name of the event or meeting.

2. Set the date. **Please use UTC time.** If using Google Calendar select Accra, Ghana or Reykjavik, Iceland since they don't have daylight saving time.

3. Set the location with the link to the zoom room.

4. Set the description. **The link to the etherpad goes here.**

5. Set notifications. It is good to have one notification on the day before and another 10 minutes before the meeting as email.

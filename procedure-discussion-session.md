# Procedure - Instructor Discussion Session

This document describes how instructor discussion sessions
are organized and conducted.  This information is summarized in 
checklists for the hosts and discussion organizer [here](checklists-discussion-sessions.md).  

## Terminology

-   **Instructor discussion session**: an online meeting
    where instructors share experiences from teaching and
    obtain information while preparing to teach.

-   **Host**: member of the Mentoring Subcommittee
    who facilitates a discussion session.

## Motivation

1.  The Carpentries are community based projects and the community needs opportunity to interact.

2.  The Carpentries believe in jugyokenkyu, or "lesson study", and evidence-based education so instructors need opportunity to share experiences.

3. The Carpentries are continuing to increase the number of instructors and develop new lessons. New instructors would like to hear from experienced teachers who have recently taught to help prepare for upcoming workshops.

## Before the meeting

The Mentoring Subcommittee is responsible for organizing
the instructor discussion sessions so that

-   each month has at least eight discussion sessions,

-   instructors are notified at least one week in advance and

-   each session has at least one host (preferably two) to conduct the discussion.

Meeting scheduling will be coordinated via [etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion).

The dates of instructor discussion sessions are also listed
in the Carpentries community calendar,
https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=oseuuoht0tvjbokgg3noh8c47g%40group.calendar.google.com.

Email invitations should be sent to three groups of instructors:

- instructors who have taught in the previous week

- instructors who are preparing to teach in the next 4 weeks

- folks who have recently completed instructor training and need to
  attend a discussion session to complete their [instructor checkout](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/)

The contact information for the first two groups is available in [AMY](https://amy.software-carpentry.org/workshops/). 
The chair of the mentoring subcommittee, as well as all members of the Carpentries Steering committee, 
should have access to AMY. Newly trained instructors should be directed to instructor discussion sessions 
following completion of instructor training.  

## During the meeting

Meetings will be hosted via the [instructor discussion etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion).

The agenda should be similar to the following:

- Welcome and host introduction
- Attendees introduction
    - Name, affiliation/position, purpose for attending
- Report from previous workshops
    - Share some significant accomplishments and obstacles.
	- Any changes or additions to lesson material?
- Preparing for upcoming workshops
    - Specific questions about teaching and/or lessons?
- Preparing for instructor training checkout
    - Questions about checkout procedure, lessons, or workshop organization?
    - Have you asked a question here yet?
- Closing
	- What are you most excited about for teaching Software or Data Carpentry?  
- Reminder to discussion session participants: 
    - For big problems or concerns, start an issue on GitHub in the appropriate lesson or add to Google Doc of commonly mentioned concerns
    - For small typos, submit pull request to appropriate lesson

Based on discussion among the mentoring committee, temporary questions may be 
added to the agenda for 
a month of sessions, in order to collect data on specific issues.  

Each instructor discussion session session must have at least one host
from the mentoring subcommittee (although two hosts are preferred). 

The **host** is responsible for: 

- hosting the meeting and facilitating discussion using the agenda described 
[this instructor discussion etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion). 

- maintaining focus on the main goal of the session, which is to share ideas and keep instructors excited about teaching.

- ensuring instructors teaching in the near future have urgent questions or concerns addressed.

- collecting feedback from instructors who have recently taught.

- engaging newly trained instructors and evaluating their participating using a subset of 
questions described in the checkout procedure.

- encouraging attendees to create issues or pull requests to correct problems.

> If there are more than 5 workshops represented by attendees, the discussion 
session should be split into two groups, to make sure everyone has enough time 
to share.  When dividing attendees into two groups, try to balance the number of 
people who are de-briefing, who are there for pre-workshop help, and who are 
instructor trainees.  If there are exactly 5 workshops represented, it is at the 
discretion of the host whether to split the group.  


## After Hosting the meeting

- [ ] **Fill out the [host questionnaire](https://goo.gl/forms/iXkMQABmO6HROfCy1)**
	- *Note:* Please copy the list of attendees (including all attendees but removing no-shows) and paste it into question 7 of the questionnaire. 
	- This questionnaire will automatically send an email to checkouts@carpentries.org (and the mentoring co-chairs) to show that the newly trained instructors participating as a part of the checkout procedure were engaged and could answer target questions described in the checkout procedure.
- [ ] **Archive** the etherpad by clicking on the star in the top right corner. This will save a copy of the etherpad in its current state.
- [ ] **Clean** the etherpad for the next user by deleting all the community added comments and change the dates to prepare the etherpad for the next session.
- [ ] *Optional:* Write a blog post summarizing topics discussed, including (but not limited to) the following: implementation of new lessons, recurring questions about or problems while teaching, and general strategies for instructing workshops. [This template](template-blog-about-debriefing-session.md) can be used as the start point for the blog post.
